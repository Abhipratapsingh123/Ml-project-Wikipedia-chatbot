## Wikipedia Chatbot

### My Project

This project is a simple chatbot application that uses Wikipedia as a source of information. Users can input a topic and ask questions about it, and the chatbot will provide answers based on the content retrieved from Wikipedia. The chatbot leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess and transform text data before making predictions using a trained model.
